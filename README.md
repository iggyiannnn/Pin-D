# Pin-D
This is a project that I worked on for my Freshman Honors class at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
I worked with another groupmate (github.com/mansari2) as we attempted to make an iOS app that would allow users to present events happening on campus.
As this was our first iOS project, we did not manage to get far and did not succeed in the eventual goal. However, we still learnt much and this felt like a good exposure to iOS programming and Swift. 
For this project, we implement the Google Maps API and attempted, but were ultimately unsuccessful, in connecting the app to a backend server that was being implemented by other groupmates.
